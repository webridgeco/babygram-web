                    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Babygram AI ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use the Babygram AI mobile application ("App").</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Provide and maintain the App's services</li>
                        <li>Process your image transformations</li>
                        <li>Manage your credits and purchases</li>

                        <li>Communicate with you about the App</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Image Processing and Storage</h2>
                    <p>4.1. Your uploaded images are processed using OpenAI API services.</p>
                    <p>4.2. Original images are temporarily stored for processing and then deleted.</p>
                    <p>4.3. Transformed images are stored on your device's storage to allow you to download them.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4.4. What face data does the app collect?</strong> <br>
                        The app allows users to optionally upload two images: one of each parentâ€™s face. These images are used solely as visual references to generate an AI-created image of a future baby. The app does not perform facial recognition, extract biometric identifiers, or store facial landmarks or features. No actual facial data is collected beyond the temporary use of the uploaded photos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4.5. All planned uses of the collected face data</strong> <br>
                        The uploaded face images are used only as visual input to guide the AI image generation process. The images are processed in-memory and serve to personalize the output generated by the AI model (based on gpt-image-1 or similar). The data is not analyzed, stored, or used for identification, authentication, marketing, or any other purpose. Once the output is generated, the original images are immediately discarded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4.6. Will the face data be shared with any third parties? Where will this information be stored?</strong> <br>
                        No, the face data will not be shared with any third parties.
                        The images are temporarily uploaded to our secure backend server to be passed to the AI model for inference. They are held in volatile memory only during processing and are not saved, cached, or stored on our servers, databases, or cloud storage. Once image processing is completed, the images are automatically discarded.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>4.7. How long will face data be retained?</strong> <br>
                        Face data (i.e., the uploaded images) is retained only during the image generation process, which typically takes less than one minute. After the process completes, the uploaded images are deleted. No face data is retained or stored in any form after this point.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

                    </ul>
